Favorite/Unfavorite downloads in Easy Digital Downloads with just 1 click.

== Description ==

This plugin requires both [EDD Wish Lists](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/edd-wish-lists/?ref=166 "EDD Wish Lists") & [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). <strong>It will NOT function without them.</strong>

EDD Favorites is a plugin for EDD Wish Lists that allows your customers to "favorite" downloads. With 1 click (and another click to remove) the download is instantly added to the user's favorites.

**What's the difference between EDD Wish Lists and EDD Favorites?**

With EDD Wish lists, you click the "add to wish list" link and choose a list (or create a new one) from the modal window. It also works with variable pricing. EDD favorites is for quickly adding/removing downloads to a single list with 1 click. It doesn't support variable pricing, meaning you cannot add a specific price to the favorites list, instead it adds the entire download.

**Coming soon**

Favorite downloads to a specific list (like etsy), auto page creation on plugin install, share your favorites list (just like Wish Lists).
