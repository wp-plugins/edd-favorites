Favorite/Unfavorite EDD downloads in just 1 click.

== Description ==

This plugin requires both [EDD Wish Lists](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/edd-wish-lists/?ref=166 "EDD Wish Lists") & [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). <strong>It will NOT function without them.</strong>

[View Demo](http://edd-favorites.sumobithemes.com "View Demo")

EDD Favorites is a plugin for EDD Wish Lists that allows your customers to "favorite" your downloads. It also supports the [Crowdfunding](http://wordpress.org/plugins/appthemer-crowdfunding/ "Crowdfunding") plugin. By clicking a simple link, the current download (or campaign) is instantly added to a "favorites" list.

The favorites list also appears amongst the other Wish Lists (if you choose to use lists also). The ability to add a favorite download to a specific list will be coming in a future version. Just like EDD Wish Lists, once a customer registers on your website, their favorites list is moved with them, so their favorites are not lost.

Why do I want EDD Favorites?
This plugin let's customers favorite downloads in a single click. If you want customers to save price variations, stick with the default EDD Wish lists plugin.
